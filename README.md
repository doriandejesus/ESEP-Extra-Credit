# InMemoryDB README

This repository contains a simple in-memory key-value database implemented in C++.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/InMemoryDB.git
```


3. Compile the code using g++:
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o myprogram InMemoryDB.cpp main.cpp
```


5. Run the program:
```bash
./myprogram
```


7. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the InMemoryDB. You can choose options to get values, start transactions, put values, commit transactions, rollback transactions, and exit the program.

## Assignment Improvement

For this assignment, it can be modified for the future use as an official assignment most significantly in the aspect of outlining what is needed from the student. As of now, it simply states that code must be created to make a database, but it does not specify the output or final product that is desired. In my case I allowed for choices to be made by the user in the terminal when running the program, but a specified medium which we should create an application would be good. The creation of a README is also good because it continues help practicing creating and perfecting README files.
